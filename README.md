# KI-Kompetenznachweis Generator 🤖

A satirical web application that generates "official-looking" AI competency certificates, playfully addressing the bureaucratic aspects of AI regulation compliance.

## About the Project

The KI-Kompetenznachweis Generator is a tongue-in-cheek take on the growing regulatory requirements for AI systems, particularly in the context of the EU AI Act. It allows users to generate professional-looking certificates that "prove" their AI competency through a series of humorous yet thought-provoking questions.
